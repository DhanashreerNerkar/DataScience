This study focuses on a system designed to identify and categorize hemorrhages in CT scans. Different imaging techniques like CT scans, MRI, and X-rays can produce these visuals. The system's main objective is to identify hemorrhages and, when found, categorize them. To accomplish this, various initial processing steps, such as converting to grayscale, adjusting size, detecting edges, and enhancing clarity, are executed on the CT images, readying them for further evaluation. Morphological operations identify shape-related hemorrhage features, using the Sobel and marker techniques to highlight regions of interest. Subsequently, the watershed algorithm facilitates hemorrhage detection through segmentation. Once hemorrhages are detected, feature extraction is performed for classification. Active contours define hemorrhage areas, and extracted features enter a Decision Tree classifier for type determination. Results can be interpreted in collaboration with medical professionals. This research enhances hemorrhage prediction and classification in medical images, achieving 92% average accuracy in classifying three hemorrhage types. | Publication_ID: 3; Candidate_ID: 2; Publication_Title: Eight-Legged Spider Bionic Robot; Publication_Publisher: IEEE; Publication_Date: March; Publication_Author: 2019; Publication_URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10448942; Publication_Description: The innate human drive to venture into uncharted territories, uncover new realms, and continuously surpass scientific and technological limits is an irresistible force.

As volunteers we spread awareness about social issues via street plays and performances, arranged and participated in blood donation drives and participated in various activities for community well-being. We also attended seminars for first-aid and disaster management training. All NSS volunteers had to go for a week long camp where they helped a village with their daily activities. During our camp we helped a village called Warap build a dam, since their water resources get depleted over the summer unless they can store it in the rainy season. This experience instills in volunteers a sense of social responsibility, leadership skills and teaches you to work in a team. Personality development was a promised outcome for all volunteers who took genuine interest in the activities of NSS, and I was definitely one of them.; Volunteer_Start_Month: September; Volunteer_Start_Year: 2019; Volunteer_End_Month: May; Volunteer_End_Year: 2019; Volunteer_Media: None | Volunteer_ID: 7; Candidate_ID: 4; Volunteer_Organisation: Data for Social Good; Volunteer_Role: Event Coordinator; Volunteer_Cause: Science and Technology; Volunteer_CurrentlyWorking: Yes; Volunteer_Description: None; Volunteer_Start_Month: November; Volunteer_Start_Year: 2023; Volunteer_End_Month: None; Volunteer_End_Year: None; Volunteer_Media: None"
