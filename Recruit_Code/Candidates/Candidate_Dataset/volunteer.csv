4,4,Mangrove Marshalls,National Service Scheme,Environment,Yes,"Mangrove Marshalls is the largest group of people so far to clean mangroves manually. This ensures very thorough cleaning and also helps in effective segregation of waste. We coordinate with corporate sectors as well as with schools to spread awareness regarding littering your surroundings, especially the water bodies. It not only affects the growth of mangroves which are home to very rich ecosystems, but also fauna that thrive on the coast and in the water.",April,2022,,,

Some of the drives I have been a part of are feeding drives, collaring drives and tree plantation drives. They also are in touch with a group of people who regularly feed the strays in their areas. Furever meals provides these people with dog and cat food. They place water bowls for the animals during the summer and are always looking for ways to improve the quality of life of community animals.",,,,,
6,4,National Service Scheme,Student Volunteer,Social Services,,"NSS is a national level organization with chapters in various Indian colleges. As volunteers we spread awareness about social issues via street plays and performances, arranged and participated in blood donation drives and participated in various activities for community well-being. We also attended seminars for first-aid and disaster management training. All NSS volunteers had to go for a week long camp where they helped a village with their daily activities. During our camp we helped a village called Warap build a dam, since their water resources get depleted over the summer unless they can store it in the rainy season. This experience instills in volunteers a sense of social responsibility, leadership skills and teaches you to work in a team. Personality development was a promised outcome for all volunteers who took genuine interest in the activities of NSS, and I was definitely one of them.",September,2019,May,2019,
