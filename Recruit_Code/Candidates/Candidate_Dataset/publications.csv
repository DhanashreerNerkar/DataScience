2,2,Integrating Active Contours and Decision Trees for Systematic Hemorrhage Detection,IEEE,March,2019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10448726,"Medical imaging is a pivotal tool for visualizing internal bodily structures and comprehending organ and tissue functions. This study focuses on a system designed to identify and categorize hemorrhages in CT scans. Different imaging techniques like CT scans, MRI, and X-rays can produce these visuals. The system's main objective is to identify hemorrhages and, when found, categorize them. To accomplish this, various initial processing steps, such as converting to grayscale, adjusting size, detecting edges, and enhancing clarity, are executed on the CT images, readying them for further evaluation. Morphological operations identify shape-related hemorrhage features, using the Sobel and marker techniques to highlight regions of interest. Subsequently, the watershed algorithm facilitates hemorrhage detection through segmentation. Once hemorrhages are detected, feature extraction is performed for classification. Active contours define hemorrhage areas, and extracted features enter a Decision Tree classifier for type determination. Results can be interpreted in collaboration with medical professionals. This research enhances hemorrhage prediction and classification in medical images, achieving 92% average accuracy in classifying three hemorrhage types."

4,2,Text Segmentation and Transliteration Using Deep Learning,IEEE,January,2024,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10389998,"Reading text from images is crucial for understanding image content. This can range from scanned documents with predominant text, video frames with captions, or photos with naturally occurring text. Recognizing text in images can be used in various ways, such as indexing multimedia, assisting drivers by recognizing signs, aiding visually impaired individuals with scene descriptions, or identifying vehicles via license plates. The surge in affordable digital cameras and high-quality mobile phone cameras has intensified the focus on extracting text from photographs in the field of computer vision. While there are many OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems, the preliminary step is to segment the text from the image. This project aims to extract and segment text from natural images, process it through an OCR, and enhance its usability through transliteration. It aims to enhance image-based text recognition by segmenting text from natural images, processing it with OCR, and amplifying its utility through transliteration, catering to diverse applications like multimedia indexing and aiding the visually impaired."
5,2,Secure Auditing with Encrypted Trace Logs in Multi-Cloud Storage Management,IEEE,January,2024,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10389994,"Cloud computing revolutionizes the way resources are utilized, offering a platform where they can be dynamically allocated based on demand. This on-the-fly data processing and storage capability has led various providers to offer both free and premium storage solutions. However, with a multitude of providers in the market, accessing data scattered across them can be cumbersome. Hence, the emergence of multi-cloud storage management tools, which provide a unified interface for users to seamlessly access data without juggling between multiple providers. Though authenticated access safeguards data, maintaining its integrity requires oversight of user activities. This calls for the implementation of a Trace Log that meticulously records each action. Such logs, while crucial for auditing, are sensitive and can be vulnerable. To bolster their security, encryption techniques can be implemented, using unique user-specific keys. This not only enhances the log's security but also ensures controlled, authenticated access. A proposal for a robust, secure, and efficient system to manage and monitor data across multiple cloud platforms."
6,2,Blockchain and Deep Learning-Based Models for Crypto Price Forecasting,IEEE,January,2024,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10391785,"Blockchain technology is becoming more and more popular because of its decentralized, unchangeable, safe, and anonymous characteristics. Cryptocurrencies, which have seen tremendous development and market capitalization in recent years, are where they are most widely used. Individuals, organizations, and businesses are all making significant investments in this area. In contrast to conventional commodities markets, the cryptocurrency market is more volatile, unstable, and unpredictable. It can be affected by a variety of technological, emotional, and legal variables. Although there has been a lot of research towards predicting cryptocurrency prices, many of the current methods are not appropriate for use in real time. To solve this, we suggest using the Python-based LGBM Neural network model to forecast market changes in real-time and reduce investor losses. The outcomes of our evaluation of this strategy using reference datasets show its dependability. Thus, over the past ten years, researchers from a variety of domains have used neural networks as an efficient data mining method."
7,2,Fake Product Detection Using Blockchain Using QR Code,IEEE,December,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10391448,"Issues such as service duplication, inadequate departmental coordination, and a lack of standardization often plague supply chain management due to a lack of transparency. Counterfeiting has become increasingly prevalent, making it extremely difficult to visually identify counterfeit products. Counterfeiters cause significant challenges for legitimate firms, yet far too many people have no idea of the entire amount of counterfeit items’ influence on brands. Various approaches have been developed in the past to address the challenge of product counterfeiting. The most popular methods are using RFID tags, Artificial Intelligence, QR Code based systems, etc. Each of them had a few disadvantages such as the QR Code can be copied from a genuine product and placed on a fake product, artificial intelligence uses CNN and machine learning which needs heavy computational power and so on. The idea of this paper is to improve detection of fake products by linking product SN with customer ID in the seller’s system. This is achieved with Blockchain technology which ensures the identification and traceability of real products through QR Code. Blockchain based systems, makes everything decentralized. One of its main advantages is that the recorded data is difficult to change without the consent of all parties concerned which makes the data extremely secure and protected from all vulnerabilities."
